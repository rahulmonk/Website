This is a brand new post created to test the build system from end to end. If you are seeing this, it means the Python script successfully found this file, read its metadata, and injected its content into the blog post template.

The process involves a few key steps:

Writing: This is the part where the content is created in a simple .md file.

Building: The build.py script converts this file into a full HTML page.

Linking: The script then updates the index.html file to include a link to this new page.

This workflow makes managing a static site simple and efficient.
